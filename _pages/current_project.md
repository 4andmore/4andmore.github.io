Views of Switzerland
=====================

Une fÃªte de Village en Suisse
-----------------------------
Inspired by a journey through rural Switzerland in 1809, Austrian composer Sigismund Ritter von Neukomm wrote a *Quintetto dramatique*. Neukomm describes the 4 movements of his quintet as follows: 

***No. 1.*** *The music describes the moment just before sunrise. Nature gradually awakens; the shepherd calls his flock; the echoing birdsong heralds a beautiful day; the sun rises and all creatures, revitalised by its rais, proclaim the wonders of nature with a thousand voices.*

***No. 2.*** *All villagers make their way to church to celebrate the patron saint's day.*

***No. 3.*** *The midday sky is clear and the heat intense. Clouds form, the sky darkens and a terrible thunderstorm breaks. Once it is over, the clouds scatter and the sun returns in full splendour.*

***No. 4.*** *The villagers gather on the green. Their games and laughter get livelier and louder; they finally start to dance; dancing is interrupted by the shepherd who, playing a herdsman song (the Ranz des Vaches), brings home his leaping herd. The dancing resumes, then the bell rings three times for Vespers while the pious villagers say the Angelus prayer. This signals the end of dances and games, and they all happily go home, their hearts full of pleasant memories.*

Montferrine of Misquotes
----------------------------
A few strangely classical notes made it into the traditional folk dance from Fribourg called *Montferrine du pays d'Enhaut*. Can you name the tunes?
